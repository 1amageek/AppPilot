### 6. Stress Tests (ST-01 to ST-05)
**Location:** `Tests/E2ETests/StressTests.swift`

- **ST-01:** Random click stress (1000 operations)
- **ST-02:** Random type stress (500 operations)
- **ST-03:** Mixed operations with concurrency
- **ST-04:** Memory leak detection (long-running)
- **ST-05:** Error recovery stress testing

**Key Features:**
- Memory usage monitoring (RSS growth < 15MB requirement)
- Performance metrics (operations/second, response time)
- Concurrent operation testing
- Error recovery verification
- System resource monitoring
